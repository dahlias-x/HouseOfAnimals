## House Of Animals

Welcome To House Of Animals! This project was made with Laravel. It was a group project to make a functioning blog page, that is connected to the Database.
There's a login system thanks to Laravel Breeze.
Sadly the image upload doesn't really work yet, because we didn't have enough time to fix it. Everything else works and we are very proud of ourselves!
